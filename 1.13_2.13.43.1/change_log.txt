fixed an error where sometimes iscanceled would become locked as true, not allowing canceling of sleep.
added a new spam checker for sleep and cancel.
  it is now user based, and not world based.
Should be multiverse compatible.
added cancellimit: 60 to config.yml
Added config file updater, copies olf configs to new config file.
